Problem:  best house for sale in a neighborhood

  - extract feature spaces:  Size, age, lot size, # bedrooms
     - need to scale features based on different units (i.e. Size vs Age)
     - look for correlated features (i.e. size & # of bedrooms)
     - predict values
     - cluster common items (documents, tweets, images, people)
  
Problem:  find similar regions in an image
  - pixel features:  R, G, B, X, Y
  
Problem:  Spam filter

cluster vs classifications:  Classifications are labeled, clusters are observed.

Regression: Gradient Descent (y = mx + b) find m & b with minimal error based on given data points.

Classification problems:

   - K-Nearest Neighbors (simple, slow)
   - training (neural net, support vector machine, logistic regression)
   
Neural Networks (not too difficult to implement)
  - weighted connections to label observations.  Feed incorrect labels back into the network for weight adjustment.
  
Problem:  Use neural nets to learn logical And, Or, Not by example. Xor requires multiple layers.

K-means clustering.  Find cluster centers.  Stupid simple.  Sucks because you need to choose K.

Good coursera learning course.  Many libraries exist.
